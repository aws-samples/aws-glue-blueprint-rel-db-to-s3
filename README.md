# Integrate data from Relational Databases into S3 Data Lake
This blueprint contains  components that can be used  to accelerate deployment of data lake solutions on AWS. The blueprint deploys parameterized AWS Glue components that can be used to pull data from relational databases to the S3 based data lake. 

## How is this blueprint different from the AWS Lake Formation blueprint?
This blueprint is different from the AWS Lake Formation blueprint in the following aspects : 
1. This blupeint gives you the option to leverage either python-shell or pyspark as a source to raw component. The AWS Lake Formation blueprint defaults all components to pyspark. Leveraging a python-shell component helps reduce costs where the amount of data to be processed is not high.
2. This bluprint not only pulls full or incremental data from the source to the raw layer, but also merges your data from the raw to the curated layer. It does so using a number of parameters supplied to the job. The AWS LakeFormation blueprint simply pulls full or incremental data to the raw layer and does not merge data with the curated layer.

## Architecture Overview
The following diagram shows the architecture leveraged by the blueprint.

### Data Extraction Components
The extract components extract data from the source layer and push it to the "Raw" data lake layer in parquet format. There are two variants of the source to raw layer components. You can decide on which component type to use depending on the type of source database, the amount of data to be pulled and the degree of parallelism desired. Choice of the component has significant impact on the cost. So, try to leverage the python-shell component as far as possible.
1. **AWS Glue python-shell component** - This component leverages the [aws-data-wrangler](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler) library to extract data from a relational source database and pushes the data into the raw layer in the data lake. This component can be configured to either do a full extract or an incremental extract. For an incremental extract, the component leverages a [AWS DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/) table which stores the bookmark values. The component is fully paremeterized and takes number of parameters such as AWS Glue connection name, source table and schema names as well as other parameters to control the nature of the pull. This component can be used to create a AWS Glue job to run with either 0.0625 DPUs or 1 DPU depending on the amount of data to be pulled from the source. Definition of DPU is available [here](https://aws.amazon.com/glue/pricing/). The component supports MySQL and PostgreSQL databases as a source.

2. **AWS Glue pyspark component** - This component leverages AWS Glue pyspark to connect to the source database and pushes the data into the raw layer in the data lake.This component can be configured to pull incremental data using [Glue Bookmarks](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/monitor-continuations.html) or do full extracts.For large source tables, it can also be configured to pull data in parallel over JDBC connections.The component is fully paremeterized and takes number of parameters such as  source table and schema names as well as other parameters to control the nature of the pull.This component can be configured to run with a minimum of 2 DPUs. This component should be used when a large amount of data needs to be pulled from the source using multiple partitions in parallel.

### Data Load Component
This component leverages pyspark to merge data extracted from the source in the raw layer into the curated layer in the data lake. This component is parameterized  to handle merges for various scenarios such as mutable and immutable data, partitioned vs unpartitioned storage layer in the curated zone etc.

### DynamoDB Control Table
This table holds the bookmark values that are used to control the incremental  extracts by the python-shell source to raw component. 

## Pre-requisites
Follwoing are the pre-requisites for deploying the blueprint.
1. **VPC** - Identify a VPC which will be used to connect to the source database. The subnets in the VPC need to have outbound connectivity to the internet as well as connectivity to Amazon S3 and DynamoDB over Gateway end-points. The subnets in the VPC should also have private connectivity to the source database.More guidance on this is provided [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/start-connecting.html) .

2. **Data Lake S3 Bucket** - Create a S3 bucket to setup the data lake. To improve security of your data lake, you can setup the S3 bucket with appropriate server side encryption. Make sure that the S3 bucket is not publicly accessible.

3. **IAM Roles** - You will need to create an IAM role which would be associated with the deployed Glue jobs and crawlers. This role should have adequate access to all the needed S3 buckets, DynamoDB Table and the AWS Glue catalog as well as Cloudwatch logs. For guidance on how to setup this IAM role, please refer to the AWS Glue documentation [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/getting-started-access.html). In addition to this role, you need to create another IAM role that would be used to create a workflow using the blueprint. This role needs to have access to create appropriate S3 buckets, upload objects to S3, create Glue jobs and create DynamoDB tables .   

4. **Glue connection**  - Setup a Glue connection to the source databases.Details on how to setup a Glue connection are available [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/glue/latest/dg/console-connections.html).

5. **Glue crawler** -  Setup and run a Glue crawler to crawl the source database using the Glue connection. The crawler will create tables in an appropriate database in the AWS Glue catalog. This step is needed only if you plan to use pyspark to pull data from the source to the raw layer.

6. **Parameter file** - The blueprint deployment needs a parameter file in JSON format to create the jobs. This parameter file has all the details for each table such as whether the pull is full or incremental, whether the data is mutable or immutable etc. to setup appropriate Glue jobs to pull and process the data. For this, create a parameter file in JSON format and upload it to a S3 bucket. More guidance on how to create the parameter file is provided later in this documentation. A sample parameter file has also been provided with the blueprint.

7. **Curated layer Glue catalog Database** - Create a database in the Glue catalog that would be used to store the tables in the curated layer. This corresponds to the curated layer in our database and the definitions of our curated layer tables would be held here. If one is not created before deployment of the blueprint, the same would be created during the blueprint deployment process.

8. **Wheel file for the AWS Data Wrangler python package** - If you want to leverage python-shell jobs for source acquisition, you will need to download the .whl file from [here](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-data-wrangler/releases) and upload it to a S3 bucket.

## Deployment 
To deploy this AWS Glue blueprint, zip the contents of the rel_db_to_s3 folder in this repository into a zip file and upload the zip file to an Amazon S3 bucket. Create an AWS Glue blueprint using the zip file in the S3 bucket. Create a workflow using the blueprint to deploy the AWS Glue jobs needed to hydrate the S3 data lake from your relational data store. Additional help needed to provide parameter values for creation of the workflow using the blueprint as well as creation of the parameter file is provided below.
